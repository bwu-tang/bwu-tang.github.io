As a security professional and lifelong student, I am interested in employing pragmatic approaches to balance security with usability, elevating organizations above the cybersecurity poverty line, and improving the cybersecurity talent pipeline. 

Outside of work and school, I am spending time with my family, enjoying the outdoors, exploring new places, cooking, and tasting delicious foods.
