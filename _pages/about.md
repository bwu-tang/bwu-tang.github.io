### What I Do

I’m a cybersecurity practitioner and PhD student studying <a href='https://dsu.edu/academics/colleges/beacom-college/'>Cyber Operations at Dakota State University</a>, with a career spanning technical leadership roles in fintech, cloud computing, and large-scale platform security.  

My professional work has focused on building and operating security programs that strike a pragmatic balance between risk and usability. I’ve developed security strategy and architecture, led security engineering initiatives, and advused executive leadership and boards on risk, regulatory expectations, and long-term security investment. I’ve worked closely with product and engineering teams to improve security outcomes without slowing delivery, particularly in highly regulated and fast-moving environments.

### What I'm Exploring

My academic and research interests focus on applied cyber defense, with an emphasis on translating real-world security challenges into defensible, scalable models. I am particularly interested in developing cost-effective security frameworks for resource-constrained organizations, defining usable security practices, and examining how organizational, economic, and human factors influence security outcomes.  

More broadly, I aim to bridge industry practice and academic research by grounding theory in operational practices. I am also interested in cybersecurity workforce development as a systems problem, examining how the supply of cybersecurity talent can be better matched to organizational demand across different sectors and resource constraints.

### Outside of Work

Beyond cybersecurity, I enjoy spending time with my family, getting outdoors, traveling, cooking, and eating good food. Lately I’ve been getting back into piano after a two decade hiatus and spending time at the climbing gym.
