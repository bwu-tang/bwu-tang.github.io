## What I Do

I’m a cybersecurity practitioner and PhD student studying <a href='https://dsu.edu/academics/colleges/beacom-college/'>Cyber Operations at Dakota State University</a>, with a career spanning technical leadership roles across fintech, cloud computing, and large-scale platform security.

I focus on building and running security programs that balance real-world risk with usability. Over the years, I’ve designed security strategy and architecture, led engineering initiatives, and advised executive teams and boards on risk, compliance, and long-term security planning. I enjoy working alongside product and engineering teams to improve security outcomes without slowing things down, especially in fast-moving or highly regulated environments.

I also work directly with startups, small and medium-sized businesses, and non-profit organizations to help them grow safely. I partner with teams to understand their security posture, prioritize risks, and implement solutions that protect people and data while letting the organization move quickly. My goal is to make security practical, usable, and sustainable so it supports the mission rather than getting in the way.

## What I'm Exploring

My academic and research interests focus on applied cyber defense, with an emphasis on translating real-world security challenges into defensible, scalable models. I am particularly interested in developing cost-effective security frameworks for resource-constrained organizations, defining usable security practices, and examining how organizational, economic, and human factors influence security outcomes. More broadly, my work seeks to bridge industry and academia by grounding theory in real-world operations.  

I am also interested in cybersecurity workforce development as a systems problem, examining how the supply of cybersecurity talent can be better matched to organizational demand across different sectors and resource constraints.

## Outside of Work

Beyond cybersecurity, I enjoy spending time with my family, getting outdoors, traveling, cooking, and eating good food. Lately I’ve been getting back into piano after a two decade hiatus and spending time at the climbing gym.
